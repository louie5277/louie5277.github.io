							<h3>Army Heat Acclimatisation Training</h3>
							<p>During the COVID-19 Circuit Breaker period, ensuring military personnel maintained peak physical fitness was a challenge. To address this, I collaborated with the Army Digitalisation Office (ADO) and the Centre of Excellence for Soldier Performance (CESP) to develop a Heat Acclimatization Training App for the military.

								This app provided soldiers with customizable workouts, instructional videos, and remote progress tracking for commanders. Despite the constraints of remote development, our team successfully built and deployed the app through virtual collaboration. Additionally, we worked with volunteers from the Army Digital Troopers program, leveraging skilled digital talents from across the Army to bring this project to life.
								
								This initiative demonstrated the power of digital transformation in military training, ensuring operational readiness even in unprecedented times.</p>

							<h3>Currency Tracking App</h3>
							<p>The Tracking App enhances efficiency and accountability for both drivers and commanders by digitizing vehicle tracking and performance monitoring. 
								Drivers can log mileage by platform, track their platform currency, monitor progress toward license conversion, and view past drives sorted by month or vehicle type. 
								Commanders gain access to real-time driver statistics, mileage reports, and drive history while being able to edit platform qualifications (restricted to OC & CSM). 
								The app also enables seamless drive logging, where drivers input vehicle details, odometer readings, and fuel status, with commanders approving completed drives. 
								By reducing paperwork and improving oversight, this app ensures better management of military vehicle operations.</p>
